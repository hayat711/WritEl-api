        "content": "\n\nThe sentence \"감기 때문에 학교 못 갔다\" includes a grammar rule that involves the conjunction \"때문에\" (ddeon-e). This conjunction is used to express a cause-and-effect relationship in Korean.\n\nIn this specific sentence, \"감기 때문에\" translates to \"because of a cold\" or \"due to a cold.\" Here, \"감기\" (gamgi) means \"a cold,\" and \"때문에\" (ddeon-e) indicates the cause or reason for the subsequent action.\n\nThe phrase \"학교 못 갔다\" (hakgyo mot gatda) means \"couldn't go to school\" or \"didn't go to school.\" Here, \"학교에\" (hakgyo-e) means \"to school,\" and \"못 갔다\" (mot gatda) implies the inability to perform the action due to the mentioned cause.\n\nTherefore, the overall sentence can be understood as \"I couldn't go to school because of a cold.\"\n\nThe grammar rule illustrated here is the use of \"때문에\" (ddeon-e) to express the cause or reason for an action or situation. It is important to note that \"때문에\" (ddeon-e) is used after a noun or a noun phrase, indicating the cause behind the subsequent action or event."
